# dmxsan.github.io

Welcome to my personal website, built with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) and deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This repository serves as both the source for my site (stored in `components/`, `pages/`, `layouts/`, etc.) and the final static output (located in the `docs/` folder) that GitHub Pages uses to serve the live site at [https://dmxsan.github.io](https://dmxsan.github.io).

---

## Project Overview

- **Framework:** [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (using the `docs` folder on the `main` branch)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS (you can integrate additional libraries like Tailwind if desired)
